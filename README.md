# Firefox Plugin for Browser Tools MCP

This Firefox extension is a plugin for the [Browser Tools MCP](https://github.com/AgentsDesktopAI/browser-tools-mcp) system that brings MCP functionality to Firefox and Zen browsers. While the original Browser Tools MCP provides Chrome support through its [Chrome extension](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/browsertoolsmcp/kdkanpjfnngldeajhaanidonaihpaoij), this plugin extends the ecosystem to Firefox-based browsers.

The plugin integrates with the Browser Tools MCP architecture to provide AI assistants with detailed information about elements selected in Firefox browsers, including styles, dimensions, animations, and hover effects - all automatically without requiring manual intervention.
